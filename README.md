## get crackin‚Äô (installation)
1. **clone it like you own it**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolk.git
   cd yolk
2. **install the egg-sentials**
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **local dev**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
## what's in the coop (tech stack)
- **Vite**: because waiting for a slow dev server is like waiting for water to boil‚Ä¶painful.
- **React**: i love hooks. that's it
- **TailwindCSS**: because manual margins are for masochists.
- **Typescript**: types mean fewer errors, more time for breakfast.

## how to use
1.	arrow up/down: pick your egg style. (soft, medium, hard, or poached.)
2.	click the yolk: the timer starts.
3.	wait for the alarm
4.	got more eggs to try? rinse and repeat, chef.
